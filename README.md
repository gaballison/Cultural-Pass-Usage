# Cultural Pass Usage

A C# console app designed to allow users to view and modify information about the 2019 [Cultural Pass](https://fundforthearts.org/culturalpass/) venues. It uses [Json.net](https://newtonsoft.com/json) to serialize and deserialize data from a Json file containing information about each Venue.

## Future Plans
I didn't have time to make this as robust as I'd hoped, but I would like to enhance it with options to generate the CSV files necessary for reporting in [Beanstack](https://beanstack.com).
